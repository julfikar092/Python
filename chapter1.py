# practice problem 1: Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.

# firstNum = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# secondNum = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# sum = firstNum + secondNum
# print("The sum is:", sum)


# pratice problem 2: take an input value of one side of a square and print the area of the square.

# inputSide = float(input("Enter the side of the square: "))

# print("The area of the square is:", inputSide * inputSide, "square units")

# practice problem 3: Write a program to take two floating point numbers as input and print their average

# firstNumber = float(input("Enter the first floating point numner:"))
# secondNumber = float(input("Enter the second floating point number: "))

# print("Average of the two numbers is:", (firstNumber + secondNumber) / 2)

firstNumber = int(input("Enter the first fnumner:"))
secondNumber = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

print(firstNumber >= secondNumber)
